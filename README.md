Augmented Compass

Augmented Compass is a simple virtual reality app that overlays cardinal directions on a video feed from the camera. The most challenging aspect of this app was converting a 0 to 360 angel measurment to 0 to 600 which is the position of a direction(label) on screen. Then, of course, this direction(label) needed to be centered to give the perception that the user was pointing at a direction. Although the directions flicker in and out, which is an issue I still need to address, I did get the correct direction to display in the middle of the screen.
